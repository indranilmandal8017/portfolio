      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am Indranil Mandal, a researcher in Transportation Engineering and currently pursuing my PhD at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. My doctoral research focuses on developing a comprehensive two-wheeler rider behavior model to improve road safety in mixed traffic environments. I am also working as a Junior Research Fellow (JRF) on a CSIR–CRRI project aimed at developing warrants for segregated traffic lanes for motorized two-wheelers, addressing conflicts with larger vehicles, and enhancing overall safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold a B.Tech-M.Tech Dual Degree in Civil and Transportation Engineering from IIEST Shibpur. During my M.Tech, my thesis investigated the effects of e-rickshaws on traffic mobility and near-road air quality, optimizing their proportion using genetic algorithms and applying logit models for commuter choice. I have also worked in the area of mode choice behavior of commuters' with various weather conditions 
      </p> 
      <p>
      I have authored research accepted in Transportation Research Record (2025), studying platooning tendencies of e-rickshaws and their impact on urban fringe air quality. I aim to contribute towards sustainable, safe, and data-driven urban mobility solutions.
